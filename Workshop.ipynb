    "The power of python lies with Object Oriented Programming. But what does this mean? Take the example from the slides. A table is an object which has properties such as colour, made out of a certain material, price, and so forth. But to build the same table in a different colour, doesn't require you to use a different building blueprint. This blueprint is what meant by a **Class**. The class describes how you can build an object. Take a look at the example code from the slides in the `classes/Example` to get a general understanding of how classes work. When you use a class to make an object with certain **attributes**, it is called an **instance**. You can have more than two different instances of the same class which have different attributes, like a brown and black table. The benefits of using classes is that it avoids repetitive programming, data is easily temporarily stored, or maybe just a place where you want to store functions. In the following section you will make a class that describes employees of a company.\n"

Important attributes of an employee at a company could be their name, birthday, company id, and what else you find important. <br> <br>*Extra: if you want to add extra attributes but you don't know what yet, you can add `**kwargs` as a variable and make that an attribute of the class. kwargs stands for keyword arguments. This attribute is then a tuple of extra attributes that can be different for everyone.
